                If you do not confirm intent to attend nor pay your due now balance, you will be purged!

                <br>
                Check your Due Now balance every day before the purge to make sure you don't miss a payment. Your Due Now balance should be <b>$0</b> by the purge date, or you will be purged.

                <br>
                <ul><li><i>Workday -> Profile -> Personal -> Additional Data -> Confirmation of Intent to Attend - {Quarter here}</i></li></ul>
